      ABSTRACT = {
      Active optical media leading to interaction Hamiltonians of the form $H=\lambda(a+ a^{\dag} )^{\xi}$ represent a crucial resource for quantum 
      optical technology. In this paper, we address the characterization of those nonlinear media using quantum probes, as opposed to semiclassical ones. 
      In particular, we investigate how squeezed probes may improve individual and joint estimation of the nonlinear coupling $\lambda$  
      and of the nonlinearity order $\xi$. Upon using tools from quantum estimation, we show that: i) the two parameters are compatible, i.e. 
      the may be jointly estimated without additional quantum noise; ii) the use of squeezed probes improves precision at fixed overall energy 
      of the probe; iii) for low energy probes, squeezed vacuum represent the most convenient choice, whereas for increasing energy an optimal squeezing 
      fraction may be determined; iv) using optimized quantum probes, the scaling of the corresponding precision with energy improves, both for individual 
      and joint estimation of the two parameters, compared to semiclassical coherent probes. We conclude that quantum probes represent a resource to enhance 
      precision in the characterization of nonlinear media, and foresee potential applications with current technology.},

ABSTRACT = {In a recent paper we have described an optical implementation of a measure-once one-way quantum finite automaton recognizing a well-known family of unary periodic languages, accepting words not in the language with a given error probability. To process input words, the automaton exploits the degree of polarization of single photons and, to reduce the acceptance error probability, a technique of confidence amplification using the photon counts is implemented. In this paper, we show that the performance of this automaton may be further improved by using strategies that suitably consider both the orthogonal output polarizations of the photon. In our analysis, we also take into account how detector dark counts may affect the performance of the automaton.},
